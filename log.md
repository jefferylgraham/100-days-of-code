# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Wednesday, January2, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Redid the information security challenges on freeCodeCamp

**Thoughts**: It's been a month since I've done anything that would count towards the 100 days of coding challenge. I've been doing some WordPress/PHP along with CSS customization for a client project, but wasn't consistently coding. But as we enter a new year, I'm recommiting myself to the challenge and made it a goal to get a job as a web developer by the end of the year. Excelsior!
