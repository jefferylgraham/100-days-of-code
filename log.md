# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Wednesday, January 2, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Redid the information security challenges on freeCodeCamp

**Thoughts**: It's been a month since I've done anything that would count towards the 100 days of coding challenge. I've been doing some WordPress/PHP along with CSS customization for a client project, but wasn't consistently coding. But as we enter a new year, I'm recommiting myself to the challenge and made it a goal to get a job as a web developer by the end of the year. Excelsior!

### Day 2: Thursday, January 3, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Redid the quality assurance & testing challenges on freeCodeCamp

**Thoughts**: Sat down a wroye down my goal of becoming advanced in JavaScript. Keeping this goal in the forefront of my mind will help me stick to my promise to code at least an hour a day, even on those days when I'm feeling down. Surprisingly the hour goes by fast. I need to focus on the the quality of what I get done when I'm coding rather than quantity. Slowing down and actually assimilating the info will help me retain the information and contribute to my goal of becoming advanced in JS.


### Day 3: Friday, January 4, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Redid some of the advanced node & express challenges on freeCodeCamp

**Thoughts**: Going slower to fully assimiltae the information & knowledge. I'm not going to force myself to push through all the challenges to finish, but will stop and allow myself to digest the information. Going forward I need to turn off the tv and reduce the number of distractions so I can fully focus on the gaining the knowledge.
