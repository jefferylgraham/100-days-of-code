# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: Wednesday, October 31, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished the freeCodeCamp Timestamp Service project

**Thoughts**: It's been a week since I've writen any code so I've restarted the challenge. After this break, I was worried about how much I would remember and if I would have to start my learning all over. It was a little rocky at first, but I found my groove pretty quickly. I was even able to finish a project that had me stuck 10 days ago!

### Day 1: Thursday, November 1, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished the freeCodeCamp Header Parser Service project

**Thoughts**: I'm on a roll with the node/express projects, which means a curveball is about to be thrown my way. But it feels good to be coding again.

### Day 3: Saturday, November 3, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the freeCodeCamp Url Shortener Service project

**Thoughts**: As always, I got lulled into false sense of security with the first 2 projects. This project is kicking my behind! My hiatus got be back into bad habits, namely coding without thinking things through first. I need to stop that. Immediately!

### Day 4: Sunday, November 4, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished the freeCodeCamp Url Shortener Service project

**Thoughts**: I built this! It felt daunting at first. but when I broke eveything step by step and handled eveything step-wise, it felt a little easier. In awe of how far I've come since I first started and excited about where this will take me.
