# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: Wednesday, October 31, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished the freeCodeCamp Timestamp Service project

**Thoughts**: It's been a week since I've writen any code so I've restarted the challenge. After this break, I was worried about how much I would remember and if I would have to start my learning all over. It was a little rocky at first, but I found my groove pretty quickly. I was even able to finish a project that had me stuck 10 days ago!

**Today's Progress**: Finished the freeCodeCamp Header Parser Service project

**Thoughts**: I'm on a roll with the node/express projects, which means a curveball is about to be thrown my way. But it feels good to be coding again.
