# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: Wednesday, October 31, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished the freeCodeCamp Timestamp Service project

**Thoughts**: It's been a week since I've writen any code so I've restarted the challenge. After this break, I was worried about how much I would remember and if I would have to start my learning all over. It was a little rocky at first, but I found my groove pretty quickly. I was even able to finish a project that had me stuck 10 days ago!

### Day 1: Thursday, November 1, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished the freeCodeCamp Header Parser Service project

**Thoughts**: I'm on a roll with the node/express projects, which means a curveball is about to be thrown my way. But it feels good to be coding again.

### Day 3: Saturday, November 3, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the freeCodeCamp Url Shortener Service project

**Thoughts**: As always, I got lulled into false sense of security with the first 2 projects. This project is kicking my behind! My hiatus got be back into bad habits, namely coding without thinking things through first. I need to stop that. Immediately!

### Day 4: Sunday, November 4, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished the freeCodeCamp Url Shortener Service project

**Thoughts**: I built this! It felt daunting at first. but when I broke eveything step by step and handled eveything step-wise, it felt a little easier. In awe of how far I've come since I first started and excited about where this will take me.

### Day 6: Tuesday, November 6, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the freeCodeCamp Exercise Tracker project.

**Thoughts**: Spent 30 minutes trying to fix a fatal issue with my git repository after being unable to commit any changes. Finally figured out what to do but still have no idea why the error occured.

### Day 7: Wednesday, November 7, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the freeCodeCamp Exercise Tracker project.

**Thoughts**: I started coding tonight expecting to finish the project, but several hours later I was only abe to eke out a few lines of code. I spent forever trying to figure out how to use `req.query`. I finally figured it out, but by the time I did, my brain was fried. Hopefully, I'll finish up tomorrow. FInger crossed...

### Day 8: Thursday, November 8, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the freeCodeCamp Exercise Tracker project.

**Thoughts**: Made progress on the project. Need to find out how to use the optional parameters in the request query. Has to be a leaner solution than using a bunch of if statements.

### Day 9: Friday, November 9, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished the freeCodeCamp Exercise Tracker project.

**Thoughts**: 4 out of 5 microservice projects completed. Hopefully, I'll finish the last one over the weekend. Node.js, mongoose and MongoDB are starting to make sense to me.

### Day 11: Sunday, November 11, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked on unit testing with chai & mocha. Update my portfolio with recent projects.

**Thoughts**: Didn't experience too much difficulty with testing. Just have to remember the syntax.

### Day 12: Monday, November 12, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked on advanced node & express challenges on freeCodeCamp

**Thoughts**: Spent 30 minutes trying to figure out an error I was getting. I got the code directtly from the challenge, but couldn't figure out why it wasn't working. Finally, figured out it was bc the version of MongoDb I was using used slightly different syntax than the exercise examples. Just a small reminder of how web development is constantly evolving and it pays to be a problem solver.

### Day 13: Tuesday, November 13, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked on advanced node & express challenges on freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts**: So some of the tests on a challenge are failing, but the functionality of what the app is supposed to do is there. A google search shows that others have faced similar issues with this challenge and have offered that there is something wrong w/ the testing suite. Question is, do I trust that I've done everything correctly and move on or do I trust the tests and work to pass them even though it looks like everything is working? Dilemmas!

### Day 14: Wednesday, November 14, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked on more advanced node & express challenges on freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts**: Back-end is mutha! But I like it!

### Day 15: Thursday, November 15, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Started the #freecodecamp Metric-Imperial Converter project. Added the security requirements and implemented the first set of tests.

**Thoughts**: I got that initial sense of "how the hell am I going to do this", that I used to get when I first started coding, when I first looked at the project requirements. However, immediately my next thought was, "it'll be challenging, but I can do it. And I'll learn alot along the way. I got this."

### Day 16: Friday, November 16, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the #freecodecamp Metric-Imperial Converter project and implemented some more of tests.

**Thoughts**: It's interesting when you get a boilerplate of code with "suggestions/hints" of how to go about a solution. Getting comfortbale enough with my skills to abandon the "suggested route" and do my own thing.

### Day 17: Saturday, November 17, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the #freecodecamp Metric-Imperial Converter project and completed all of the unit test. Now on to the functional tests.

**Thoughts**: Haven't been able to focus as much so it's slow going, but I'm making progress. And learning.

### Day 19: Monday, November 19, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished the freecodecamp Metric-Imperial Converter project

**Thoughts**: Spent over an hour trying to fix an error due to a missing "/" in the route. SMH! But I eventually figured it out.

### Day 20: Tuesday, November 20, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Started the freecodecamp Issue Tracker project

**Thoughts**: Looked at the all the stuff I had to do to implement the project and fely overwhelmed. Looked at the first requirement and thought to myself "I can figure that out". Looked at the 2nd requirement and thought, "I can figure that out". Get the picture?

###Day 21: Wednesday, November 21, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Continued work on the freecodecamp Issue Tracker project

**Thoughts**: Took me a while to get some momentum but I was able to get implement 3 tests. Slow going, but it's going.

###Day 23: Friday, November 23, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Continued work on the freecodecamp Issue Tracker project

**Thoughts**: Took me a few days to figure out how to use mongodb without mongoose, bur I finally figured it out. The back-end is stressful, but I feel like if I can figure this out, I can figure out anything. And I'm sure I will.

###Day 24: Saturday, November 24, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Continued work on the freecodecamp Issue Tracker project

**Thoughts**: Worked on updating the db based on form input. I'll work on the tests tomorrow. I haven't been as focused the last couple of days. Need to get my coding mojo back.
