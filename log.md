# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Saturday, August 18, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp. I finally
finished the Intermediate JavaScript challenges (with some help).

Started the JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Projects and finished the
Palindrome Checker projects. The code feels clunky, but it's all mine.

**Thoughts** It feels good to have some accountability in my coding practice. And
I'm seeing that the development community is very supportive. Had a problem committing
solution to GitHub and almost got dragged down a rabbit hole.
