# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: Wednesday, October 31, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished the freeCodeCamp Timestamp Service project

**Thoughts**: It's been a week since I've writen any code so I've restarted the challenge. After this break, I was worried about how much I would remember and if I would have to start my learning all over. It was a little rocky at first, but I found my groove pretty quickly. I was even able to finish a project that had me stuck 10 days ago!

### Day 1: Thursday, November 1, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished the freeCodeCamp Header Parser Service project

**Thoughts**: I'm on a roll with the node/express projects, which means a curveball is about to be thrown my way. But it feels good to be coding again.

### Day 3: Saturday, November 3, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the freeCodeCamp Url Shortener Service project

**Thoughts**: As always, I got lulled into false sense of security with the first 2 projects. This project is kicking my behind! My hiatus got be back into bad habits, namely coding without thinking things through first. I need to stop that. Immediately!

### Day 4: Sunday, November 4, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished the freeCodeCamp Url Shortener Service project

**Thoughts**: I built this! It felt daunting at first. but when I broke eveything step by step and handled eveything step-wise, it felt a little easier. In awe of how far I've come since I first started and excited about where this will take me.

### Day 6: Tuesday, November 6, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the freeCodeCamp Exercise Tracker project.

**Thoughts**: Spent 30 minutes trying to fix a fatal issue with my git repository after being unable to commit any changes. Finally figured out what to do but still have no idea why the error occured.

### Day 7: Wednesday, November 7, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the freeCodeCamp Exercise Tracker project.

**Thoughts**: I started coding tonight expecting to finish the project, but several hours later I was only abe to eke out a few lines of code. I spent forever trying to figure out how to use `req.query`. I finally figured it out, but by the time I did, my brain was fried. Hopefully, I'll finish up tomorrow. FInger crossed...

### Day 8: Thursday, November 8, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the freeCodeCamp Exercise Tracker project.

**Thoughts**: Made progress on the project. Need to find out how to use the optional parameters in the request query. Has to be a leaner solution than using a bunch of if statements.

### Day 9: Friday, November 9, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished the freeCodeCamp Exercise Tracker project.

**Thoughts**: 4 out of 5 microservice projects completed. Hopefully, I'll finish the last one over the weekend. Node.js, mongoose and MongoDB are starting to make sense to me.

### Day 11: Sunday, November 11, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked on unit testing with chai & mocha. Update my portfolio with recent projects.

### Day 12: Monday, November 12, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked on advanced node & express challenges on freeCodeCamp

**Thoughts**: Spent 30 minutes trying to figure out an error I was getting. I got the code directtly from the challenge, but couldn't figure out why it wasn't working. Finally, figured out it was bc the version of MongoDb I was using used slightly different syntax than the exercise examples. Just a small reminder of how web development is constantly evolving and it pays to be a problem solver.
