# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: Saturday, August 18, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp. I finally
finished the Intermediate JavaScript challenges (with some help).

Started the JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Projects and finished the
Palindrome Checker projects. The code feels clunky, but it's all mine.

**Thoughts** It feels good to have some accountability in my coding practice. And
I'm seeing that the development community is very supportive. Had a problem committing
solution to GitHub and almost got dragged down a rabbit hole.

### Day 1: Sunday, August 19, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through 2 projects on FreeCodeCamp - JS Algorithms
& Data Structures. Complete Caesar's Cipher and Roman Numeral Converter

**Thoughts** My code doesn't feel lean/efficient. I'll go back and look at the
advanced solutions to get an idea of other ways to complete the tasks.

### Day 2: Monday, August 20, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked on regular expressions and lookaheads. Completed the
Telephone Number Validator project at freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I hate Regexes in general. But I've learned more about them today than
I ever have in the past. The hints from freeCodeCamp gave me good leads and using
the online Regex tools were tremendously helpful. My regex is VERY long, but it's all mine & works!

### Day 3: Tuesday, August 21, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked on cash register project at freeCodeCamp. Made little progress
on a working program.

**Thoughts** I'm coding before actually writing down the steps and/or pseudocode. I just start writing code and next thing I know is I'm writing a long program and I'm not sure where the bugs are coming in. I need to sit and think about the process and write functions for parts of the program that are repetitive.

### Day 4: Wednesday, August 22, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked on cash register project at freeCodeCamp. Made more progress
on a working program. Have one of the tests passing.

**Thoughts** Breaking the program into functions is very helpful in keeping the track of the state of the register, as well as state of the amoount of money owed. I used "state". I must have React on the brain. But I coded way more than I realized today. That wakatime is very helpful in keeping track of how much time I'm spending on coding.

### Day 5: Thursday, August 23, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked on cash register project at freeCodeCamp. Just one tiny change & I'll be done.

**Thoughts** This has taken all day! But seeing a former Airmen like myself get into coding gave me more encouragement. I need to work on debugging. Learning alot about functions & whatnot.

### Day 6: Friday, August 24, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished the cash register project. FINALLY! I've earned my JavaScript certification. Celebrated by working on some WordPress/PHP development.

**Thoughts**: I was about to quit and go on to the next section at freeCodeCamp and come back to the project later. But I kept thinking about the problem and how to handle it step-wise. I am becoming a better coder!

### Day 7: Saturday, August 25, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Went through some of the front end library challenges at [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/).

**Thoughts**: Gaining a newfound respect for CSS and feeling more comfortable with the design aspect of web development.

### Day 8: Sunday, August 26, 2018

**Today's Progress**: FInished the front end library challenges at [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/). Started the random quote generator project using React

**Thoughts**: Actually drew out the design before starting to write stuff down. Having an idea of what
the project will look like is helpful, especially if building with React. Draw stuff out to know exactly what "components\* will look like & go. Need to study wireframing.

### Day 9: Monday, August 27, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished the random quote machine at [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/).

**Thoughts**: It felt good to build my first React app w/o a tutorial. Actually felt like I knew what I was doing. Code feels lean. Still need more practice, but I'm getting more comfortable with React. Instituting the pomodoro technique is helpful.

### Day 10: Tuesday, August 28, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Switched gears and did some PHP.

**Thoughts**: A little bit of Imposter Syndrome crept up today. Doubted my ability to build the Markdown Preview project. But I KNOW I can do it.

### Day 11: Wednesday, August 29, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Started the markdown preview project. Put together the components. Also, looked at some JavaScript Essentials videos with Mor10.

**Thoughts**: I'm sure I can build the markdown previewer. But I want to have a strong foundational knowledge of JavaScript. Component building is helpful. Breaking the project into smaller steps helps troubleshooting and coming to an overall solution.

### Day 12: Thursday, August 30, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the markdown preview project. Read some of [Practical Modern JavaScript](https://ponyfoo.com/books/practical-modern-javascript) by Nicolas Bevaqua.

**Thoughts**: Didn't make as much progress as I wanted. Ended up refactoring out the buttons. It'll make it easier I think to add functions to them. Need to learn how to pass props to nested components.

### Day 13: Friday, August 31, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the markdown preview project. Looked at some of JavaScript video by [Beau Carnes](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/@beaucarnes)

**Thoughts**: I keep starting the project over because I'm not taking the time to think out the logic of the project. Need to *think* about what components make up the project, and how they relate and *React*.

### Day 14: Saturday, September 1, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the markdown preview project some more. Made more progress today than during the last three days combined.

**Thoughts**: Sat down this morning and thought out the logic of the project. Thinking about it and thinnking through how & when the components render was very helpful. Once I thought through how everything worked and interacted, coding a solution became easier. Just need to figure out the parsing into Markdown.

### Day 15: Sunday, September 2, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished the functionality of the markdown preview project. Just need to work on styling now. 

**Thoughts**: dangerouslySteInnerHTML is thr scariest property I've ever heard of. I like FCC because I always learn something new when completing a project.

### Day 16: Monday, September 3, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked on styling for the markdown previewer project.

**Thoughts**: Didn't put in an hour yesterday, but I did get something done. I could have already submitted but I care about how my project looks. I want to be good at this.
