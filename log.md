# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: Saturday, August 18, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp. I finally
finished the Intermediate JavaScript challenges (with some help).

Started the JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Projects and finished the
Palindrome Checker projects. The code feels clunky, but it's all mine.

**Thoughts** It feels good to have some accountability in my coding practice. And
I'm seeing that the development community is very supportive. Had a problem committing
solution to GitHub and almost got dragged down a rabbit hole.

### Day 1: Sunday, August 19, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through 2 projects on FreeCodeCamp - JS Algorithms
& Data Structures. Complete Caesar's Cipher and Roman Numeral Converter

**Thoughts** My code doesn't feel lean/efficient. I'll go back and look at the
advanced solutions to get an idea of other ways to complete the tasks.

### Day 2: Monday, August 20, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked on regular expressions and lookaheads. Completed the
Telephone Number Validator project at freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I hate Regexes in general. But I've learned more about them today than
I ever have in the past. The hints from freeCodeCamp gave me good leads and using
the online Regex tools were tremendously helpful. My regex is VERY long, but it's all mine & works!

### Day 3: Tuesday, August 21, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked on cash register project at freeCodeCamp. Made little progress
on a working program.

**Thoughts** I'm coding before actually writing down the steps and/or pseudocode. I just start writing code and next thing I know is I'm writing a long program and I'm not sure where the bugs are coming in. I need to sit and think about the process and write functions for parts of the program that are repetitive.

### Day 4: Wednesday, August 22, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked on cash register project at freeCodeCamp. Made more progress
on a working program. Have one of the tests passing.

**Thoughts** Breaking the program into functions is very helpful in keeping the track of the state of the register, as well as state of the amoount of money owed. I used "state". I must have React on the brain. But I coded way more than I realized today. That wakatime is very helpful in keeping track of how much time I'm spending on coding.

### Day 5: Thursday, August 23, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked on cash register project at freeCodeCamp. Just one tiny change & I'll be done.

**Thoughts** This has taken all day! But seeing a former Airmen like myself get into coding gave me more encouragement. I need to work on debugging. Learning alot about functions & whatnot.

### Day 6: Friday, August 24, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished the cash register project. FINALLY! I've earned my JavaScript certification. Celebrated by working on some WordPress/PHP development.

**Thoughts**: I was about to quit and go on to the next section at freeCodeCamp and come back to the project later. But I kept thinking about the problem and how to handle it step-wise. I am becoming a better coder!

### Day 7: Saturday, August 25, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Went through some of the front end library challenges at [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/).

**Thoughts**: Gaining a newfound respect for CSS and feeling more comfortable with the design aspect of web development.

### Day 8: Sunday, August 26, 2018

**Today's Progress**: FInished the front end library challenges at [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/). Started the random quote generator project using React

**Thoughts**: Actually drew out the design before starting to write stuff down. Having an idea of what
the project will look like is helpful, especially if building with React. Draw stuff out to know exactly what "components\* will look like & go. Need to study wireframing.

### Day 9: Monday, August 27, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished the random quote machine at [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/).

**Thoughts**: It felt good to build my first React app w/o a tutorial. Actually felt like I knew what I was doing. Code feels lean. Still need more practice, but I'm getting more comfortable with React. Instituting the pomodoro technique is helpful.

### Day 10: Tuesday, August 28, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Switched gears and did some PHP.

**Thoughts**: A little bit of Imposter Syndrome crept up today. Doubted my ability to build the Markdown Preview project. But I KNOW I can do it.

### Day 11: Wednesday, August 29, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Started the markdown preview project. Put together the components. Also, looked at some JavaScript Essentials videos with Mor10.

**Thoughts**: I'm sure I can build the markdown previewer. But I want to have a strong foundational knowledge of JavaScript. Component building is helpful. Breaking the project into smaller steps helps troubleshooting and coming to an overall solution.

### Day 12: Thursday, August 30, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the markdown preview project. Read some of [Practical Modern JavaScript](https://ponyfoo.com/books/practical-modern-javascript) by Nicolas Bevaqua.

**Thoughts**: Didn't make as much progress as I wanted. Ended up refactoring out the buttons. It'll make it easier I think to add functions to them. Need to learn how to pass props to nested components.

### Day 13: Friday, August 31, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the markdown preview project. Looked at some of JavaScript video by [Beau Carnes](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/@beaucarnes)

**Thoughts**: I keep starting the project over because I'm not taking the time to think out the logic of the project. Need to _think_ about what components make up the project, and how they relate and _React_.

### Day 14: Saturday, September 1, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the markdown preview project some more. Made more progress today than during the last three days combined.

**Thoughts**: Sat down this morning and thought out the logic of the project. Thinking about it and thinnking through how & when the components render was very helpful. Once I thought through how everything worked and interacted, coding a solution became easier. Just need to figure out the parsing into Markdown.

### Day 15: Sunday, September 2, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished the functionality of the markdown preview project. Just need to work on styling now.

**Thoughts**: dangerouslySteInnerHTML is thr scariest property I've ever heard of. I like FCC because I always learn something new when completing a project.

### Day 16: Monday, September 3, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked on styling for the markdown previewer project.

**Thoughts**: Didn't put in an hour yesterday, but I did get something done. I could have already submitted but I care about how my project looks. I want to be good at this.

### Day 17: Tuesday, September 4, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished the markdown previewer project!

**Thoughts**: After passing the mandatory tests, I wasn't going to tackle the bonus tests. I was going to move onto the drum machine and come back to the bonus tests _later_. But I knew the likelihood of me actually revisiting the tests were slim to none. So I decided to hold off the drum machine project until I solved the bonus tests. Turns out that after some research into the [markedjs](https://marked.js.org/#/USING_ADVANCED.md) documentation, it wasn't as daunting as I thought it'd be.

### Day 18: Wednesday, September 5, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Started the drum machine project

**Thoughts**: I haven't run into any major challenges yet which makes me believe I'm probably doing something wrong.

### Day 19: Thursday, September 6, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the drum machine project. Have all drum pads playing a sound when pressed.

**Thoughts**: Still need to work on the key press event handling. Have to think it through and not try to rush to a solution. My code looks more streamlined than it did yesterday. I was excited about building out the drum pads and setting their props/attributes dynamically

### Day 20: Friday, September 7, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished the drum machine project. Have all drum pads playing a sound when pressed or when the corresponding key on the keyboard is pressed

**Thoughts**: Some of the tests on the FCC didn't go through even though the functionality is in my app. The same goes for the example FCC posted. Have to investigate to see if it's a bug or not

### Day 21: Saturday, September 8, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Started the calculator project. Built out the design for the calculator.

**Thoughts**: Used CSS grid, instead of BootStrap. Felt good to use the grid-template-area shortcut instead of defining thr full grid. I have a feeling this project is going to be a beast.

### Day 22: Sunday, September 9, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked on php with Kevin Skoglund. Started the full stack web development course by Stephen ~ [Web Developer Buddy](https://webdevbuddy.azurewebsites.net/Courses).

**Thoughts**: I am a capable web developer. I want to be a good one. I have to get into the practice of commenting my code.

### Day 23: Monday, September 10, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Switched back to working on the javascript calculator. Have the design down and the click functions. Just have to work on how to handle calculations.

**Thoughts**: My imposter syndrome got the better of me today and yesterday. I realize that my lack of focus is attributable to me lacking confidence in my abilities. I have to remind myself, although I have more to learn, I _DO_ know a lot already and am capable of learning more.

### Day 24: Tuesday, September 11, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the javascript calculator. Moved some decisions out of the functions and into the button components.

**Thoughts**: I need to sit down with some pen & paper and work through how a calculator works to get a better idea of how to tackle this project.

### Day 25: Wednesday, September 12, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked on styling some old projects. Also did some WordPress theme development.

**Thoughts**: Realized that I need to redesign my project to be fully-responsive.

### Day 26: Thursday, September 13, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked on freeCodeCamp JavaScript Calculator. Passing 11/16 tests

**Thoughts**: Today was frustrating & exhilarating. Frustrated because fixing my project to pass one test would cause it to fail tests that it previously passed. It was exhilarating because after much consternation I finally got to a place where "fixing" something didn't cause something else to break. There was a lot of sitting, sketching and meditating, but in the end I worked it out.

### Day 27: Friday, September 14, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Spent the day building my github page and revamping old FCC projects

**Thoughts**: Layouts, i.e. bootstrap, grid, flexbox, are cool! Implementing them into existing code, not so much.
